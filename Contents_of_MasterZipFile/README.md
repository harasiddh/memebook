All the logic-based components such as the configuration, the database initialisation, the models, the controllers, the apis and required validations, are all stored in the applications folder and the filenames are indicative of the contents. The templates are all stored in the templates folder, whereas the static folder contains another folder where the uploaded files can be stored. Apart from this, there is a db_directory file containing the database. There is also a .sql file if one needs to create the database and a .yaml file if one needs to debug and test and the APIs. The main.py file is also present, along with a README file that gives further instructions on how to utilize the application. Please note the presence of the two bash scripts as well, which help in setting up the development environment and running the project locally.
